# Analysis of Trader Behavior vs. Market Sentiment

## üìù Description
This project analyzes the relationship between cryptocurrency trader behavior and overall market sentiment. Using a historical dataset of individual trades and the daily Fear & Greed Index, this analysis seeks to answer key questions: Do traders act differently during periods of fear versus greed? How does market sentiment impact trading volume, frequency, and profitability?

 Key Findings & Insights
The analysis of the data reveals several distinct patterns in trader behavior, as illustrated by the charts in the `/outputs` directory.

1.  **Fear is the Primary Driver of Market Activity:** The data clearly shows that both the **total trading volume** (in USD) and the **total number of trades** peak significantly during periods of 'Fear'. This suggests that fear is a more powerful catalyst for market activity than greed, likely driven by higher volatility and panic-driven decisions.
    
2.  **Selling Pressure Increases During Fear:** The 'Buy vs. Sell' analysis shows that during periods of 'Fear', **sell orders slightly outnumber buy orders**. This finding suggests that the spike in activity during fearful periods is more likely attributable to panic selling rather than a coordinated "buy the dip" effort from traders.
    
3.  **Profitability is Not Guaranteed by Sentiment:** The distribution of Profit & Loss (PnL) is remarkably similar across all sentiment conditions. The **median profit for a single trade is close to zero** regardless of whether the market is in 'Extreme Fear' or 'Extreme Greed'. This indicates that while sentiment drives activity, it is not a reliable predictor of an individual trade's success, and both large profits and large losses can occur in any market condition.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use
To replicate this analysis, follow these steps:

1.  Place the required datasets (`historical_data.csv` and `fear_greed_data.csv`) into the `/csv_files` directory.
2.  Open and run the `notebook_1.ipynb` file in a compatible environment like Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
3.  The script will process the data, perform the analysis, and save the resulting visualization charts in the `/outputs` directory.

## üìÅ Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories:

-   notebook_1: Contains the Jupyter Notebook with the Python code for the analysis.
-   **/csv_files**: Stores the raw input data files.
-   **/outputs**: Contains all the visual outputs, graphs, and charts generated by the analysis.
-   **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project.
